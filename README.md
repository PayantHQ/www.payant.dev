### Get Started

Payant is an easy way to accept payments and make instant payouts in Africa.   
  
The Payant API helps you create your own payments flowâ€”from e-commerce to recurring payments, payouts and everything in between.  
  
To start integrating the Payant API, read our Developer Introduction.

If you are not a developer, try using our community built plugins and libraries - no code required.
